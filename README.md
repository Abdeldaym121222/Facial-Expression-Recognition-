In this paper, a lightweight patch and attention network based on MobileNetV1, referred to as PAtt-Lite,
is proposed to improve FER performance under challenging conditions. A truncated ImageNet-pre-trained
MobileNetV1 is utilized as the backbone feature extractor of the proposed method.

This is the official implementation for our paper [PAtt-Lite: Lightweight Patch and Attention MobileNet for Challenging Facial Expression Recognition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09626.pdf).
### Code has been uploaded and is available [here](Model_PattLite.ipynb). 

#### Facial Expression Recognition(FER) : 
- is a recognition task in the computer vision field, we describe the significance of FER and its applications in the field of humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI).
- is a crucial aspect of non-verbal communication, playing a vital role in person-to-person interaction. 
- Estimated 60% to 80% of communication being non-verbal.

Facial Expression Recognition (FER) Interpret human emotions by analyzing facial features such as eyebrow movement, eye contact, mouth shape, and other facial.
#### Common categories include : 
- Happiness, sadness, anger, surprise.
- fear, disgust, neutral, contempt.

## Uses of facial expression recognition (FER) :
- Intelligent robotics, Virtual reality, Psychology, Surveillance
- Animation, Digital entertainment, Criminal investigations
